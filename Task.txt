Write a function that determines whether a string is a valid guess in a Boggle board, as per the rules of Boggle.
A Boggle board is a 2D array of individual uppercase characters, e.g.:
[ ['I', 'L', 'A', 'W'],
  ['B', 'N', 'G', 'E'],
  ['I', 'U', 'A', 'O'],
  ['A', 'S', 'R', 'L'] ]

Valid guesses are strings which can be formed by connecting adjacent cells (horizontally or vertically) without re-using any previously used cells.
For example, in the above board ‘GEO’, ‘BIAS’, and ‘ILNBIA’ would all be valid guesses, while ‘BUNGIE’, ‘BINS’, and ‘SINUS’ would not.

Notes:
 • Your function should take two arguments (a 2D array of uppercase letters and an uppercase string) and return true or false depending on whether the string is found in the 2D array as per Boggle rules.
 • You do not have to check whether the string is a real word or not, only if it's a valid guess.
